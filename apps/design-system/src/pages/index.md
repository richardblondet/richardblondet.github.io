## Motivations

Building a design system was the [decision outcome](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/blob/master/docs/decisions/0007-using-a-styleguide.md) as part of the solution to the [styleguide issue](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/38) that rised wondering how to approach creating the building blocks to our personas website. 

The need for [ourself](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ourself) to have a place for all presentational components and/or a documented common visual language to enable our desired digital experience, as well as consistency is what we consider the core reason for creating this project.
