## Welcome

Hello and welcome to my personal space! This project began as a continuous effort to better understand myself, centralize different areas of my life, and fight depression. My goal is to use Carl Jung's Model of the Psyche as a framework to self-actualize my personas and continue on my journey of individuation. Through this website, I hope to explore and develop different aspects of myself, including my interests, skills, and values. 

I will be sharing more about my current work, including the motivations behind it, challenges encountered, and the strategies implemented. To document this journey, I have created a <a href="/as/blogger">Blogger</a> persona, which will serve as a platform for me to express my ideas and experiences.

Currently, I am seeking job opportunities. Please feel free to explore more about my work and experiences by visiting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardblondet/" target="_blank">my linkedin profile</a> page.
