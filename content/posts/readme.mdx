## About me

As an experienced web developer with over 8 years of experience, my focus is primarily on frontend development using TypeScript, NodeJS, and ReactJS technologies. I also have  experience working with PHP, Laravel, WordPress, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Docker, Redis, etc, and have been fulfill Full Sack Engineer roles as well.

My experience includes working on large-scale projects with multiple products, for companies in the USA, Europe, and South America, in distributed teams from across the globe, as an Independent Contractor.  I have had the opportunity to work on several high-profile projects, including those for Domino's Pizza, Stoli, and Rica, as well as collaborations for brans such as Disney, WebMD, and Toptal.

I believe in providing effective design solutions that deliver results. My approach to work is orderly and result-oriented, and I am constantly seeking ways to improve and learn quickly with a passion and eagerness to expand my skill and tool set.

When I am not coding, I enjoy exploring tools for self-improvement, writing, playing the piano, creating music, and mountain biking.

I am currently open to work opportunities in frontend development and would be happy to connect and discuss potential collaborations.
