### About The Project

US Corps Marines Recruitment ran a campaign where they tour through college schools to motivate the young to participate in an obstacle challenge. 


### Responsibilities

I was responsible for the development of the Frontend website, from turning the a PDF design asset into a full Wordpress Custom Theme and Widget Development, based on their needs and integrations.

My work also included working first hand with the decisions in development for this project. My responsibilities were developing a custom Wordpress theme and widgets to build the website for this campaign.
