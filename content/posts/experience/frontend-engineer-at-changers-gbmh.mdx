### About The Company

Changers empower healthy and sustainable lifestyles at a global scale by combining corporate wellness promotion and employee motivation with active environmental protection. During my time with changers.com I was given the task to maintain the frontend Admin side application, where users and clients admins would control and see a global overview of the services we were providing them. 

### Responsibilities

As part of my role, I had the opportunity to build a mobile hybrid app with ReactJs. The app served as an SDK for users to extend or include it within their own apps, allowing their users to include some of Changers services of environmental protection inside their own applications.

My responsibilities included maintaining the frontend admin side applications built with ReactJs and Redux architecture.
Developing a responsive themable web app with ReactJs, applying the Redux philosophy with the modern Context API, as well as using Storybook for component prototyping and delivery.
