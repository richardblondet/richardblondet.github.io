### Introduction

Hello and welcome to my personal blog, internet entity!

I started this project to address the challenges I've been experiencing with my career and identity for quite some time. From feeling stuck and experiencing career stagnation to dealing with Impostor Syndrome and facing an identity crisis, it has been quite a journey. Being able to express myself through this medium means a lot to me, especially on this milestone day - April 13, 2023.

As I brainstormed what to write about, I came up with the idea of sharing my progress using a structure similar to a [Scrum Stand Up](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups). This format will help me be objective and keep things simple. Here's what I have in mind:

- Introduction/Greeting/Context
- Stand Up
    - What I've done
    - What I'm doing
    - What's next
- Retrospective
    - DAKI (Drop, Add, Keep, Improve)
    - Take aways
- Conclusion/Farewell
- Rerefences

Since I don't have much writing experience, I'll use a technical and straightforward style and some support from ChatGPT, as I strive to embody the Blogger Archetype. In this project, I aim to create a custom blog that reflects the various dimensions, roles, and disciplines we take on as humans, inspired by Carl Jung's Persona concept. This will serve as a single source of truth for all my pursuits while also allowing me to hone my Software Engineering skills. While I'll explain the rationale behind these choices in more detail later on, let me start by sharing my progress so far, using a format similar to a Scrum Stand Up.

### Stand up

##### **What I’ve Done**

- Drafted a Data Model\
  [https://dbdiagram.io/d/63bda9876afaa541e5d19706](https://dbdiagram.io/d/63bda9876afaa541e5d19706)\
  I have adopted the term ["Persona"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology)) from [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) and used it to create a data Model that represents the various roles, masks, and areas of life in which I act.

- Chose ADR as Decision Making Tool\
  [https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/pull/2](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/pull/2)\
  I’ve decided to use [this tool](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/blob/master/docs/decisions/0001-using-madr-custom-template.md) to make or record decisions, as decision making has proven to be a difficult task.

- Bullet Traced the Main Idea\
[https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/39](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/39)\
Made it work on my local machine, played with the idea, learnt more about Nx, Tailwind, AstroJS, connected some dots.

- Soft Launched Blog With Minimal Functionality\
  [https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/48](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/48)\
  I have identified the key requirements for starting to share my blog posts while showcasing the concept without extensive explanation. To do this, I will share my Software Engineer and Blogger personas and add relevant content, including this very post.

##### **What I'm Doing**

- Addressing Technical Debt\
  [https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/50](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/50)\
  I plan to update my website by adding some features such as a navbar and footer, while also fixing and organizing anything that needs attention. In addition, I aim to start technical writing and experiment with that persona as well. I'll ensure that everything necessary is in place to support this endeavor.

- Looking For A Job (blocker)\
  If you or anyone you know is in need of a Frontend or Fullstack Developer (with Node.js experience), please reach out to me! I am eager to enhance my professional and financial prospects.

##### **What's Next?**

- Google Photo Media Sourcing\
  [https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/51](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/51)\
  It is going to be the next big thing for the blog, because will allow us to share media directly from one of our main media sources. Will also enable room for the personas: MTB Hobbyist, and others to come.

- Adventure Quest: Things To Figure Out\
  There are several things I need to figure out, such as finding a strategy to work periodically and predictably that aligns with my availability. I plan to improve my writing skills by writing regularly and integrating technical writing into my projects. Additionally, I am considering ways to incorporate a mailing feature or other means of notification for friends, family, and building a community.

### Retrospective

##### DAKI

- Drop\
  I'm paying close attention to how I'm approaching tasks to find the right process and balance. After trying Github issues for writing content, I decided to drop the idea of using it as it didn't fit my needs. 

- Add\
  Instead, I will implement a work process that aligns with my goals and schedule. 
  
- Keep\
  Currently, I'm using Github Projects and Issues for task management in development projects, and I plan to continue doing so. 
  
- Improve\
  However, I want to improve how I update the updatedAt field in mdx content and manage the content files for different Personas.

##### Takeaways

- I've found that using ADR (Architecture Decision Records) has been a game-changer for me when it comes to decision making. With so many options and approaches available, testing and documenting the outcomes and consequences of decisions has been incredibly helpful and reassuring.

- While experimenting quickly and pragmatically can be useful for decision making, it's important to distinguish between informed decisions and those based on availability heuristics.

### Conclusion

Reaching this point was challenging, and I'm excited to see where this project goes from here.

Starting this project has been humbling, but it has also positively influenced me by giving me a sense of confidence that I thought was lost for years, and something to look forward to.

I will continue to share my progress and ideas in future posts and will keep this one pinned for reference and continuation. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Best, Richard.
