### Introduction

Hello and welcome to my personal blog, internet entity!

I started this project to address the challenges I've been experiencing with my career and identity for quite some time. From feeling stuck and experiencing career stagnation to dealing with Impostor Syndrome and facing an identity crisis, it has been quite a journey. Being able to express myself through this medium means a lot to me, especially on this milestone day - April 13, 2023.

As I brainstormed what to write about, I came up with the idea of sharing my progress using a structure similar to a [Scrum Stand Up](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups). This format will help me be objective and keep things simple. Here's what I have in mind:

- Introduction/Greeting/Context
- Stand Up
    - What I've done
    - What I'm doing
    - What's next
- Retrospective
    - DAKI (Drop, Add, Keep, Improve)
    - Take aways
- Conclusion/Farewell
- Rerefences

To provide some more context about this project, I came up with the idea of building a custom blog that reflects the different dimensions, roles, and disciplines that we play as humans. This way, I can have a single source of truth for everything I do while also flexing my Software Engineering skills.

I will expand with the rationale behind everything later, but for now here's the stand up.

### Stand up

##### **What I’ve Done**

- Drafted a Data Model\
  [https://dbdiagram.io/d/63bda9876afaa541e5d19706](https://dbdiagram.io/d/63bda9876afaa541e5d19706)\
  I’ve decided to “borrow” the term [Persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology)) from [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) and created an data model based on the roles, masks, areas of life, in which ‘I’ act.

- Chose ADR as Decision Making Tool\
  [https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/pull/2](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/pull/2)\
  I’ve decided to use [this tool](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/blob/master/docs/decisions/0001-using-madr-custom-template.md) to make or record decisions, as decision making has proven to be a difficult task.

- Bullet Traced the Main Idea\
[https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/39](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/39)\
Made it work on my local machine, played with the idea, learnt more about Nx, Tailwind, AstroJS, connected some dots.

- Soft Launched Blog With Minimal Functionality\
  [https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/48](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/48)\
  Decided what's required to start sharing and logging while still showing the concept, made a hello-world post.

##### **What I'm Doing**

- Addressing Technical Debt\
  [https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/50](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/50)\
  I'm going to be adding some things I left behind (navbar, footer, etc) as well as fixing and organizing anything I deem necessary. Maybe until I find a job.

- Looking For A Job\
  Solving my employment status.

##### **What's Next?**

- Google Photo Media Sourcing\
[https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/51](https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/51)\
It is going to be the next big thing for the blog, because will allow us to share media directly from one of our main media sources. Will also enable room for the personas: MTB Hobbyist, and others to come.

- Things To Figure Out / Adventure Time\
There are things I need to figure out once, like a planning strategy to work periodically and predictably, in a way that aligns to my aviability.  Also figure how to connect Personas to Mailing Lists or other means of periodically updating for community building. I also want find a way to introduce technical writing projects.


### Retrospective

##### DAKI

- Drop: Mixing writing projects with coding projects.
- Add: Implement a work process that aligns with the desired goal.
- Keep: Github Projects + Github Issues for project task management.
- Improve: The way we update the mdx content fields like `updatedAt`, and how to manage Personas content files.

##### Takeaways

- Try new things quickly to learn fast.
- Be mindful of the difference between informed decisions and availability heuristics.
- Separation of concerns matters.
- The work generated can inspire content ideas.

### Conclusion

Reaching this point was challenging, and I'm excited to see where this project goes from here.

Starting this project has been humbling, but it has also positively influenced me by giving me a sense of confidence that I thought was lost for years, and something to look forward to.

I will continue to share my progress and ideas in future posts. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Best, Richard.
