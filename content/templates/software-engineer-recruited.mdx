## What's the correct way? recruite **by** Company X or recruited **for** Company X? 

Both phrases are correct, but they have slightly different meanings.

**"Recruited by Company X"** implies that the company is the one doing the recruiting, and they have selected you to join their team.

**"Recruited for Company X"** implies that you were recruited to work for Company X, but it may not necessarily be the company itself that did the recruiting. For example, you could have been recruited by a staffing agency or a headhunter to work for Company X.

So, which phrase to use depends on the context of the situation. If you're talking about the company's recruitment process, "recruited by Company X" is more appropriate. If you're talking about your own job search and how you landed a job at Company X, "recruited for Company X" would be more accurate.
