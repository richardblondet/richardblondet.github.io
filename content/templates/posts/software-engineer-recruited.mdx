**Sep 2013** - **Feb 2014**

### About The Company

Media Revolution SRL is a company dedicated to the development of platforms and software, located in Santo Domingo, National District.

### Responsibilities

My primary role involved converting PSD files into functional HTML/CSS designs for ad campaigns across various betting platforms, which were provided to me by companies from different industries across the globe. As I grew more experienced, I expanded my skill set to include the development of ads with the company's UX/UI approach, aimed at enhancing user engagement with the services offered.

### Tools, Tech & Skills

The tools used at the time were: 
- Sublime Text 2 as the main text editor
- MAMP server to display and share the work inside the local network
- HTML and CSS, along with Bootstrap 3. 
- Other tools included Photoshop to extract assets from design files

Some of the skills I learnt during this time were:
- Responsive Web Design.
- Basic Javascript for making dynamic pop up ads

### What's the correct way? recruite **by** Company X or recruited **for** Company X? 

Both phrases are correct, but they have slightly different meanings.

**"Recruited by Company X"** implies that the company is the one doing the recruiting, and they have selected you to join their team.

**"Recruited for Company X"** implies that you were recruited to work for Company X, but it may not necessarily be the company itself that did the recruiting. For example, you could have been recruited by a staffing agency or a headhunter to work for Company X.

So, which phrase to use depends on the context of the situation. If you're talking about the company's recruitment process, "recruited by Company X" is more appropriate. If you're talking about your own job search and how you landed a job at Company X, "recruited for Company X" would be more accurate.
