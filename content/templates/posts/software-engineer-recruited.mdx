### About The Company

Joysitick Interactive, now known as Incube Joystick, was a digital markeing agency based in New York with offices in LA and London, Sydney and (at the time of joining) Santo Domingo. Among their portfolio of clients were Disney, LG, Scotts and WebMD.

### Responsibilities

My responsibilities were, but not limited to implementing the designs into fully HTML + Javascript rich media ads for their clients and variety of ad campaigns, to be used in Google DoubleClick Studio and other ad placement service tools.

### Tools, Tech & Skills

The tools used at the time were: 
- Javascript
- HTML + CSS
- Other tools included Photoshop to extract assets from design files
- Sublime Text 2 as the main text editor

Some of the skills I learnt and/or flexed during this time were:
- Responsive Web Design
- Third party APIs integrations
- DoubleClick Studio and Studio Certification
- Lightbox Ads
- Mobile Rich Media
- Rich Media Gallery

### What's the correct way? recruite **by** Company X or recruited **for** Company X? 

Both phrases are correct, but they have slightly different meanings.

**"Recruited by Company X"** implies that the company is the one doing the recruiting, and they have selected you to join their team.

**"Recruited for Company X"** implies that you were recruited to work for Company X, but it may not necessarily be the company itself that did the recruiting. For example, you could have been recruited by a staffing agency or a headhunter to work for Company X.

So, which phrase to use depends on the context of the situation. If you're talking about the company's recruitment process, "recruited by Company X" is more appropriate. If you're talking about your own job search and how you landed a job at Company X, "recruited for Company X" would be more accurate.
