# Branch Naming Strategy

- Status: pending
- Date: 
- Story: https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/8

## Decision Outcome

- **Chosen Option:** GitHub Flow


### Consequences

- 

## Context, Problem Statement and Requirements

- Because we are working alone, we want to keep our branches clean and small on remote, while its okay on our local
- We want to push to master directly
- We want to start working from master always
- We want to adhere as much as possible to the issue naming and tagging
- We want to push a branch to remote only if we are not done at the end of the day. And prepend "wip/" to the name. Eg: "feature/navbar-component" on local. Still working on that? push to remote "wip/feature/navbar-component"
- We need simplicity
- No need to worry for versioning and staging/production code
- We only wany branches related to any operation on remote.
