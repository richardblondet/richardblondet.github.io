# Using Custom GitHub Actions to Deploy Static Website

- Status: pending
- Date: 
- Story: https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/20

## Decision Outcome

- **Chosen Option:** Custom Github Action
- **Rules:**
  - File name: `deploy-static-astro.yml`
  - Workflow:
    - âœ… On branch `gh-pages` push event
    - âœ… Build site
    - âœ… Add CNAME file with default domain to built artifact directory
    - âœ… Update `public_html` self branch with built artifact
    - âœ… Upload built artifact to gh-pages
    - âœ… Deploy uploaded artifact to github pages
    - âœ… Commit & push `public_html` to branch. Commit message: `CI: Updated public_html automatically`~~

### Consequences

- Instroducing possible complex workflow to maintain
- ðŸš« Possibility to use `public_html` on master as represantation of production from master. Requires to checkout from `gh-pages`
  - To use public_html automatically we will have to allow pushes to master without pull-requests, disrupting our process. (Decision - [0002](0002-branch-naming-strategy.md) â€“ Branch naming strategy))

## Context, Problem Statement and Requirements

- Decided to use Nx as code management [0004](0004-nx.md)
- Decided to use Astro as web framework [0005](0005-using-astro-as-web-framework.md)
- We want to maintain default astro development workflow, which outputs to directory: `./dist/{project_path}`
- We want to maintain `public_html` as default output directory 
- We want to maintain `gh-pages` branch as default publishing branch on push/pr-merge
- `public_html` should include a CNAME file with the default domain as content. Not the astro output built

## Decision Drivers

- âœ… Using custom development workflow with both nx and astro
- âœ… Maintain `public_html` as house for public website
- âœ… Maintain `dist/web/app` as house for built artifact
- âœ… Ability to serve `public_html` locally as production site
- âœ… Customizable


## Considered Options

- [Official Astro Github Pages Action](https://github.com/withastro/action)
- [Custom Github Action](0006-using-custom-github-actions-to-deploy-static-website.md#decision-drivers)

### Options Observations

### [Official Astro Github Pages Action](https://github.com/withastro/action)

- âœ… Maintained by the Astro team
- ðŸš« Output directory is inside project directory: `${{ inputs.path }}dist/` see [this line](https://github.com/withastro/action/blob/dc081df9eacdb11181ea51e5d05853faa5aee891/action.yml#L73)

### [Custom Github Action](0006-using-custom-github-actions-to-deploy-static-website.md#decision-drivers)

- âœ… All decision drivers
- ðŸš« Output directory cannot be automatically pushed to master from built. An alternative must be presented to allow public_html to hold the artifact
