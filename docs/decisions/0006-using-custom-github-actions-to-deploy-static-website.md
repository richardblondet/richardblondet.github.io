# Using Custom GitHub Actions to Deploy Static Website

- Status: pending
- Date: 
- Story: https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/20

## Decision Outcome

- **Chosen Option:** Custom Github Action
- **Rules:**
  - File name: `deploy-static-astro.yml`
  - Workflow:
    - On branch `gh-pages` push event
    - Build site
    - Add CNAME file with default domain to built artifact directory
    - Upload built artifact to gh-pages
    - Deploy uploaded artifact to github pages
    - Update `public_html` with built artifact
    - Push `public_html` to master. Commit message: `CI: Updated public_html automatically`

### Consequences

- Instroducing possible complex workflow to maintain
- Possibility to use `public_html` on master as represantation of production

## Context, Problem Statement and Requirements

- Decided to use Nx as code management [0004](0004-nx.md)
- Decided to use Astro as web framework [0005](0005-using-astro-as-web-framework.md)
- We want to maintain default astro development workflow, which outputs to directory: `./dist/{project_path}`
- We want to maintain `public_html` as default output directory 
- We want to maintain `gh-pages` branch as default publishing branch on push/pr-merge
- `public_html` should include a CNAME file with the default domain as content. Not the astro output built

## Decision Drivers

- âœ… Using custom development workflow with both nx and astro
- âœ… Maintain `public_html` as house for public website
- âœ… Maintain `dist/web/app` as house for built artifact
- âœ… Ability to serve `public_html` locally as production site
- âœ… Customizable
