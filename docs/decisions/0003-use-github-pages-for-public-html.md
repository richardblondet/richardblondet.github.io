- Status: accepted
- Date: 02-02-2023 14:19:10
- Story: https://github.com/richardblondet/richardblondet.github.io/issues/3

## Decision Outcome

- **Chosen Option:** Github Pages
- **Rules:** 
  - selected branch: `gh-pages`
  - directory name: `public_html`


- Since we are already using github for our public site we are keeping it. Tho might just be temporal.

### Consequences

- âœ… Low costs
- âœ… Low effort

## Context, Problem Statement and Requirements

- Because we are working alone, we want to be able to get from zero to one without investing financially and with low effort. 
- We also need to be able to deploy from the working repository

## Decision Drivers

- âœ… Already in git
- âœ… Simple Setup 
- âœ… Aligns with branching strategy
- âœ… Security and reliability
- âœ… Integrated Editor & CMS if brave enough
- âœ… Static 
- ðŸš« Static 
- ðŸš« Github Actions learning curve
